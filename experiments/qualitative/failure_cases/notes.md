# Failure Case Notes

1. Occlusion Failure:
   - Severe visual occlusion leads to delayed recovery.
   - Language constraints remain satisfied.

2. Language Conflict:
   - Conflicting goals cause conservative action selection.

3. Extreme Dynamics:
   - Unmodeled friction coefficients cause trajectory drift.
