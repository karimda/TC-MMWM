# Model Checkpoints

## Publicly Available Checkpoints

The following checkpoints are publicly available and trained exclusively on simulated data:

- tc_mmwm_simulated.pt  
  - Used for Figures 2, 3, 4, 5
  - Long-horizon stability
  - OOD generalization
  - Counterfactual reasoning
  - Ablation studies

These checkpoints enable full reproduction of all simulation-based results.

## Restricted Checkpoints

Checkpoints trained on real-world robotic data are not publicly released due to:
- Proprietary sensor calibration
- Institutional safety constraints
- Contractual obligations

Researchers may request controlled access under an MTA.
